# Lines starting with "#" are ignored by the software and don't need to be translated
# Everything to the left of the = must not be changed; this is the code used by the software to identify each line
# A few lines contain %0 which is a marker telling the software where to insert a name or filename.  The %0 should be left in the translated version
# A few lines contain %=XYZ% where XYZ is identifier of another line in this file.  The text for that identifier is substituted in place of
# %=XYZ%.  This is done automatically as the file is loaded; you can replace the %=XYZ% with the actual text, or create new substitutions.
# A small number of lines have part of the text enclosed in ((double brackets)).  In this case the ((  )) marks a clickable link within the text
# The translated text must contain (( )) but it doesn't necessarily need to be the same words

# The & character indicates the accelerator key which can used in association with Alt to select
# an item in a dialog or menu.  The character following the & is the shortcut.  The & does not appear on screen
# So "OK = &OK" means Alt+O is the accelerator key for OK buttons.
# It is necessary to ensure all keys within one dialog or menu are different.  Therefore the letter which
# is underlined will be different in each language.  For an initial translation it is best to omit the &
# completely from the translation, and if desired, add them back at the end.
# Not all text items contain "&" - only items which can be selected on screen.
